## 🌱 Inspiration
With the ongoing climate crisis, we recognized a major gap in the incentives for individuals to make greener choices in their day-to-day lives. People want to contribute to the solution, but without tangible rewards, it can be hard to motivate long-term change. That's where we come in! We wanted to create a fun, engaging, and rewarding way for users to reduce their carbon footprint and make eco-friendly decisions.

## 🌍 What it does
Our web app is a point-based system that encourages users to make greener choices. Users can:
- 📸 Scan receipts using AI, which analyzes purchases and gives points for buying eco-friendly products from partner companies.
- 🚴‍♂️ Earn points by taking eco-friendly transportation (e.g., biking, public transit) by tapping their phone via NFC.
- 🌿 See real-time carbon emission savings and get rewarded for making sustainable choices.
- 🎯 Track daily streaks, unlock milestones, and compete with others on the leaderboard.
- 🎁 Browse a personalized rewards page with custom suggestions based on trends and current point total.

## 🛠️ How we built it
We used a mix of technologies to bring this project to life:
- **Frontend**: Remix, React, ShadCN, Tailwind CSS for smooth, responsive UI.
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js for handling server-side logic.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for storing user data and points.
- **AI**: GPT-4 for receipt scanning and product classification, helping to recognize eco-friendly products.
- **NFC**: We integrated NFC technology to detect when users make eco-friendly transportation choices.

## 🔧 Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to fork an API, adapt it, and then code our own additions to match our needs. This was particularly tricky when working with the receipt scanning feature. Sending image files across the web also gave us some headaches, especially when incorporating real-time processing with AI.

## 🏆 Accomplishments we're proud of
One of the biggest achievements of this project was stepping out of our comfort zones. Many of us worked with a tech stack we weren't very familiar with, especially **Remix**. Despite the steep learning curve, we managed to build a fully functional web app that exceeded our expectations.

## 🎓 What we learned
- We learned a lot about integrating various technologies, like AI for receipt scanning and NFC for tracking eco-friendly transportation.
- The biggest takeaway? Knowing that pushing the boundaries of what we thought was possible (like the receipt scanner) can lead to amazing outcomes!

## 🚀 What's next
We have exciting future plans for the app:
- **Health app integration**: Connect the app to health platforms to reward users for their daily steps and other healthy behaviors.
- **Mobile app development**: Transfer the app to a native mobile environment to leverage all the features of smartphones, making it even easier for users to engage with the platform and make green choices.
